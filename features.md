## Characteristics of Web 3 

1. **Semantic web**: The semantic web means a web that understands humans. Web3.0's search and analysis capabilities would focus more on understanding the meaning of words and the context in which they are used. The semantic web is undeniably superior in terms of the interpretation of data, numbers, or keywords.

2. **Artificial intelligence**: Combining the capability of AI with natural language processing, Web3.0 applications can distinguish information like humans, resulting in faster and more relevant results. They become more intelligent to meet the needs of users. For example, in Web3.0, AI would prevent human-based corrupt practices such as manipulated data or biased product reviews.

3. **Connectivity and ubiquity**: Semantic metadata makes information more connected in Web3.0. The content is accessible through multiple applications as every device is connected to the internet, and services can be used anywhere with no restrictions.

4. **3D Graphics**: Spatial computing and 3D graphics are key Web3 features. Many experts have dubbed Web3 the spatial web because it has the potential to break down barriers between the physical and virtual worlds. Web3 could aid in reimagining graphics technologies and facilitate interactions with the metaverse.

5. **Blockchain and smart contracts**: Web3 incorporates blockchain technology. Thanks to this, we can have a nearly impossible-to-hack database from which one can add value to the content and things they can own virtually. It enables a trustless society by integrating smart contracts, which eliminates intermediaries, and all transactions executed are based on data from that DLT. It makes Web3.0 a powerful tool that has the potential to make the world a better place.

6. **Web3.0 works by providing users with a virtual avatar that helps identify them on the internet, makes gaming more lucrative, allows for the formation of DAOs, and integrates decentralized payments. This version of the internet is what makes digital ledger technologies and smart contracts possible.**
